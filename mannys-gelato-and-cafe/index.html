            <p>Manny's<br>
                We are a family owned business started in 2017, and we love servicing our customers! To us, nothing means more than when our guests love their experience when shopping with us.. 
                <br><br>
                Gelato<br>
                We offer 22 different flavors of gelato everyday, made fresh daily. We serve gelato, sorbetto and our new vegan gelato that is made with coconut milk! All of our offerings are made with natural and real ingredients. 
                <br><br>
                & Cafe<br>
                Our gelato is awesome, but we also offer a full coffee menu including lattes and coffee beverages. Along with our coffee menu, we also host a kitchen menu including panini's, wraps, salads, soups and more!

            <h2>Touchless Delivery</h2>
            <img src="assets/img/touchless.jpeg" alt="Person with a glove holding a paper bag.">
            <p>HOW IT WORKS
                Available 10 am to close, 7 days a week, our touch-less delivery minimizes person to person contact while still letting our awesome customers enjoy Manny’s at home! All you need to do is call us to place an order and we will be happy to guide you through our ordering process. Once our driver gets to your house/apartment/work they will drop your order off at a location chosen by yourself and our driver will call you when your order is ready to be picked up! Easy as that.
                <br><br>
                DRIVER SANITATION
                We take sanitation very seriously at Manny’s, and our drivers are taking even more steps in order to ensure your safety, as well as their own! This means processes such as hands washed before and after every delivery, sanitation gloves worn during the drop off of orders as well as hands sanitized all in-between! You can rest assured that your order is taken care of from start to finish.</p>

            <h2>Coronavirus Precaution</h2>
            <p>With new updates coming out everyday, especially when it comes to food, we are rigorously working to maintain a safe and healthy establishment for food consumption! As of now, it is safe to enter food establishments to order for carry-out only. We are able to take phone orders for either in-store pickup or our new curbside pickup option! We are also taking extra precautions above and beyond what is asked in order to ensure the safety of our team as well as our customers. If you would like to place an order, or just have any questions please give us a call!</p>
